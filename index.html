            <p><em>What type of film genre do you turn to most?</em></p>
            <input type="radio" name="variable" value="0" />  The scarier the better. Saw was tame and over-rated.
            <br/>
            <input type="radio" name="variable" value="1" />  I enjoy sci-fi horror, but not jump-scares or real terror.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="variable" value="2" />  Documentaries and adventure.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="variable" value="3" />  Comedy, anything that keeps my attention without being too intense.
            <hr>
            <p><em>What do like to do during a vacation?</em></p>
            <input type="radio" name="sub" value="0" />  Shark cage diving, spelunking caves alone, explore dangerous areas that most wouldn't visit.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="sub" value="1" />  Experience interesting places and things that make me think about the world differently.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="sub" value="2" />  See popular vacation spots I haven't been to, see new things and maybe venture to lesser known spots.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="sub" value="3" />  Roadtrip to nearby cities. I'd choose a museaum about potatoes over the bustle of New York.
            <hr>
            <p><em>Which is more important, curiosity or safety?</em></p>
            <input type="radio" name="con" value="0" />  Curiosity. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="con" value="1" />  Curiosity, but I wouldn't venture past a 'do not enter' sign for something interesting.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="con" value="2" />  Safety, but I like to do something fun now and then.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="con" value="3" />  I plan on living to 110.
            <hr>
            <p><em>What do you do for fun?</em></p>
            <input type="radio" name="tan" value="0" />  Youtube dangerous science experiments and try to repeat them. I failed highschool chemistry.
            <br/>
            <input type="radio" name="tan" value="1" />  Try something new, roadtripping without a map, read about science, anything mentally stimulating.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="tan" value="2" />  Fitness excersizes, video games.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="tan" value="3" />  Card games, plan my meals for the day.
            <hr>
            <p><em>Do you enjoy being scared?</em></p>
            <input type="radio" name="cos" value="0" /> Yes.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="cos" value="1" />  If it isn't too dangerous, yes.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="cos" value="2" />  I like light horror/thriller type movies but haunted houses are too much.
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="cos" value="3" />  No!
            <br />
